Hanna Orphans Home (HOH)
</h1></center>
</div>
<div class="article">
<p class="text">
Founded in 1994 by Hanna Teshome, Hanna Orphans Home (HOH) is an Addis Ababa-based orphanage caring for marginalized children in need of help. With branches located throughout Ethiopia, our staff cares for over 235 orphans, most of which have tragically lost their parents to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
</p>
<p class="text">
 Our goal at HOH is to offer orphans and those in the most fragile stages of infancy and early childhood a safe harbor to heal, grow, and experience genuine love.
</p>
<p class="text">
Instead of a totally institutionalized support service, we offer our children a community-based housing model in which groups of 6-12 (based on age and sex), live and play together in a home-like space with their own house mothers, family-style.
</p>
<p class="text">
In and around these homes, partnered with trained and professional attendants, we’re able to offer our children basic human needs, as well as holistic services and support including: 
<ul class="text">Food</ul>
<ul class="text">Clothing</ul>
<ul class="text">Schooling / Education</ul>
<ul class="text ">Education facilities</ul>
<ul class="text ">Library and Tutorial Class</ul>
<ul class="text">Medication</ul>
<ul class="text">Life Skill Training</ul>
<ul class="text">Individual and Group Counseling</ul>
<ul class="text">Entertainment</ul>
<ul class="text">Recreation</ul>
</p>
<center class="text"><h1>Goals</h1></center>
<ul class="text">1. Provide support services for HIV/AIDS victims and vulnerable children.</ul>
<ul class="text">2. Provide educational and school supplies to community children without access.</ul>
<ul class="text">3. Provide support to the destitute and elderly in and around Addis Ababa.</ul>
<ul class="text">4. Rehabilitating recently freed children from imprisonment with their parents.</ul>
<ul class="text">5. Financially supporting alumni who are now attending university.</ul>
<ul class="text">6. Repairing homes of the widows in the community.</ul>
<center ><h1 class="text">General Assembly and Board Organization</h1></center>
<p class="text">Our General Assembly acts as our policy-making body. An executive board, which answers to the General Assembly, manages the overall activities, program, and vision of HOH. Serving as a secretary without a vote, the duties of our Executive Director are to report progress of the activities of the organization to the board, while also coordinating, monitoring, and evaluating the various over-arching activities and progress of the organization.</p>
<center><h1 class="text">Achievement</h1></center>
<p class="text">Currently, our children attend schooling every level from kindergarten, all the way through university. Many of our children go on to complete secondary and post-secondary education, successfully deploying into many fruitful career paths including:
</p>
<ul class="text">Accountants</ul>
<ul class="text">Information and Communication Technologists</ul>
<ul class="text">Secretaries</ul>
<ul class="text">Barbers</ul>
<ul class="text">Purchasers and Human Resource Managers</ul>
<ul class="text">Electricians</ul>
<ul class="text">Lawyers</ul>
<ul class="text">Teachers</ul>
<ul class="text">Hotel managers</ul>
<ul class="text">Hair dressers</ul>
<ul class="">….and more.<ul>
<p class="text">Thanks to the visionary leadership of Hanna,and the support from our organizational and individual donors, stakeholders, and the government, Hanna Orphans Home is able to provide forgotten children with a second chance at life.
